# Important: Do Not Merge This Branch

This branch was created by Jonas Elsper for the study: Influence of code quality hints in tutorial systems for block-based programming languages.

Currently, the branch only includes one tutorial, namely the Fruit Catching Tutorial.
This tutorial was adapted for the study.

We conducted the study with ScratchLog and used to the option to automatically upload the project for each student. So the first step of the tutorial was not necessary for the study, because it only checked whether sprites and background are dowloaded correctly and all sprites are visible.
